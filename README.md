# Campus-Coder-Project

Within this repository are the individual project i've worked on at Campus Coders as an Artificial Intelligence Intern.

1. Fraud Detection System.
Requriements:
Build a robust fraud detection system for financial transactions. 
Use machine learning models, anomaly detection techniques, and real-time data processing to identify suspicious activities and protect users from fraud.

2. Real-time Object Detection
Requirements:
Implement a real-time object detection system using deep learning (eg: YOLO or SSD). Users can use their webcam to detect and track objects. This project can be used for security, tracking, and more
