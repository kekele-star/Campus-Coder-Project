# Real-time Object Detection using Machine Learning

This project utilizes machine learning models for real-time object detection. It employs a combination of computer vision techniques and deep learning algorithms to identify and label objects in live video streams.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a system that can detect multiple objects in a video feed in real-time. It uses pre-trained models and frameworks like TensorFlow and OpenCV to achieve this. The system continuously analyzes frames from a video source, identifies objects within these frames, and provides real-time visual feedback with bounding boxes and labels around detected objects.

## Key Features

- Real-time object detection in live video streams.
- Multiple object detection with labeled bounding boxes.
- Ability to handle various types of objects and scenarios.
- Easy integration with different cameras or video sources.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kekele-star/realtime-object-detection.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd realtime-object-detection
    ```

2. Run the object detection script:

    ```bash
    python object_detection.py
    ```

3. Follow on-screen instructions for selecting the video source or camera.

## Customization

- The project uses a pre-trained model by default. To use a different model or fine-tune the existing one, refer to the model customization guide in `models/README.md`.
- Adjust the confidence threshold or other parameters in the `object_detection.py` script to fine-tune object detection based on specific requirements.
