## Installation
To use this system, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://kekele-star/fraud-detection.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download and preprocess the data (refer to [Data](#data) section).

## Usage
Once installed, follow these steps to run the system:
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Execute the main script: `python main.py`
3. Follow the prompts or API instructions for using the system.

## Features
- Utilizes various machine learning algorithms for fraud detection.
- Allows for customization of features and model parameters.
- Provides both command-line and API interfaces for ease of use.
- Generates reports and visualizations for analysis.

## Data
The system uses a dataset containing transactional information. Ensure the data is preprocessed and formatted correctly before use. The dataset should include features like transaction amount, location, time, and any other relevant information.

## Model
The system uses a trained machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict fraudulent transactions based on the provided dataset. The model is trained on historical data and tuned for optimal performance.

## Evaluation
The system's performance can be evaluated using various metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve analysis. Additionally, cross-validation and testing on unseen data can be performed to assess its generalization capabilities.
